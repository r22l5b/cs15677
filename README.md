COMP 6211   Biometrics Coursework
A system   is   required to   recognise   people   by   images of their   body shape. You   are   provided with images of clothed subjects standing on   a   (static)   treadmill   in   our   gait   laboratory. This   is   part   of the Large Southampton Gait   Database   [Shutler et al   2004]. You   are   required to   design   a   biometric   system that can   be   used to   recognise these subjects   as   individuals. The   dataset   is   in   two   folders:   in   the first folder two   images are available for each   subject,   the   second   folder   repeats   some   subjects,   but   not all of these subjects, again   in two   views.   You   should   not   use   the   subject   identification   number for   recognition,   it   is there to   aid development. You should   also   not   use   a face   recognition   system for your   biometric system since the   biometric system you   are   expected to   develop   should   be   based on   body shapes.   However, you are allowed to   use   a   face   detection   algorithm   to   detect   faces and   use the face   location with   respect to other   body   parts   in your   analysis.
The   main objectives are to derive   measures that   can:
i) show   histograms of   intra and   inter class variations   of   subjects.
ii)   present Correct Classification   Rates for subject   recognition; and
iii) compute   Equal   Error   Rate   (EER) for subject verification/recognition and then   present   the   Correct   Classification   ra代 写COMP 6211 Biometrics CourseworkMatlab
代做程序编程语言te for the subject verification at the computed   EER.
You also   need to   present all   necessary   performance   measures for your system.
You can   use any   implementation system, though   reward will   be   made for   sophistication.   A   basic system could   use   manual   measurement, an   Excel spreadsheet and   compare   recognition   and verification   performances with a   random   result.   More sophisticated versions can   include computer vision and   machine   learning approaches and aim for   automated   recognition   and verification   of these   subjects   by their   body   image.
You are   required to write a   max 2000 word   report   describing   your   approaches   and   your   results. The   report should   be submitted zipped together with any   operational   code. The   format   of the   report should follow the   IEEE formats and should   include Abstract,   Intro,   Method,   Results,   Discussion,   Conclusions and   References   (if any). The zipped file should   be   submitted   to   the   ECS   Handin   system,   by   28th    March   2025   at   4pm.
The   marking scheme   is:
Report   presentation   25%
Recognition   performance 25%
Selection and justification of approaches   used for feature extraction   25%
Analysis of the overall   method: advantages, disadvantages   and future   directions   25%
Total   100%
This coursework will constitute 30% of the   total   assessment   for   COMP   6211   Biometrics
